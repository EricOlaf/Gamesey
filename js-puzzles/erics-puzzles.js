//Given an amount of trees and area make a function to calculate how many total animals can live there. Each resource is reusable to all animals. Ex: 3 acres could have one wolf, one elk, three badgers and three rabbits.

//Wolves need at least 3 acres and 30 trees  and 2 elk per wolf.
//Elk need at least 2 acres and 40 trees per elk.
//Badgers need at least 1 acre and 20 trees per badger.
//Rabbits need at least 1 acre and 10 tress per rabbit.

const animalCalc = (trees, acres) => {
  return 0;
};

//Make new classes each extending the old class, then make a final instance.
//HumanClass =>  MagicalHumanClass => WizardClass => HarryPotterInstance
//You can make the classes with whatever properties you want making sure that the properties that it inherits from parent classes are desired and that no unecessary ones are inherited.
